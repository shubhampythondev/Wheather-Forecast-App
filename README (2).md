# Wheather Forecast App

A Weather Forecast application allows users to obtain weather information for a chosen location in real-time. The application typically consists of a user interface where users can input the location they want to check the weather for. Upon submitting the location, the application fetches data from a weather API and displays the weather forecast on the screen.
