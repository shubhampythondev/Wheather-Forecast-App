# Wheather Forecast App

A Weather Forecast application allows users to obtain weather information for a chosen location in real-time. The application typically consists of a user interface where users can input the location they want to check the weather for. Upon submitting the location, the application fetches data from a weather API and displays the weather forecast on the screen.

* Defines the input field for users to enter the location and the area where weather information will be displayed.

2.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

* Used for styling and visually enhancing the appearance of the web page.
* Defines the colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design of the Weather Forecast application to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

3.JavaScript:

* Used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web page.
* Handles user input, retrieves weather data from the API, and updates the UI with the fetched weather information.

4.Weather API:

* Provides weather data for specific locations, including current conditions and forecasts.
* Typically accessed through HTTP requests from the client-side JavaScript code.
